                <p>
                    I have had the pleasure of working with Lasse at the Munkebjerg Group, where Lasse was employed as an account manager in my team.
                    In the above position, Lasse has been responsible for serving customers in Zealand and Greater Copenhagen within the private and public segment. In addition, he has been responsible for the budget and should develop the company's revenue, earnings and market position in his district.
                    Lasse has during the period of employment partly worked independently, and partly to cooperate with his superiors and the conference departments in the hotels to our full satisfaction.
                    Lasse is an incredibly loyal employee and has done his job to our full satisfaction, and we give him our best recommendations for a possible. future employer.
                    Lasse is an incredibly comfortable, well-liked and trustworthy person who both manages to catch customers and colleagues and he never gives up before the order is done. 
                    I can give Lasse my best recommendations. See less
