Welcome to my personal landing page. 

I have made it as a showcase of my current qualifications at working with HTML and CSS.
I also have understanding of Javascript and Jquery, however I still need quite some studying and practice before I will call them qualifications.

I am used to working with command line both locally and in connection with Github.
For text edditors I have used both Atom and Visiual Studio Code. Personally I prefer working with VSC since their color pallette is easier to use and I also find their automatic path finder for href/url very efficient. 
Working with colors, then I prefer working with hsla, since I find it to have the widest palette to work with.
